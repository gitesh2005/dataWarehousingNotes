                            <li>A data warehouse is a large <strong>centralized repository</strong> that stores data collected from various internal and external sources.</li>
                            <li>It is primarily used to <strong>analyze data</strong> and support business decision-making rather than handle daily transactions.</li>
                            <li>Data stored in a warehouse is structured, cleaned, and transformed to ensure <strong>consistency and accuracy</strong>.</li>
                            <li>It acts as a <strong>single source of truth</strong> for an organization, making information easily accessible to decision-makers.</li>

                            <li>They support <strong>complex queries and reports</strong>, which might be slow or difficult on operational systems.</li>
                            <li>Data is often loaded into the warehouse using <strong>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)</strong> processes.</li>
                            <li>A warehouse is usually <strong>separated from operational databases</strong> to avoid performance issues on live systems.</li>
                            <li>It allows organizations to combine data from multiple departments like sales, finance, and marketing.</li>

                           <li><strong>Multidimensional data</strong> represents data organized into cubes with multiple dimensions (e.g., time, product).</li>
                           <li>A <strong>dimension</strong> is a perspective for analyzing data, while <strong>measures</strong> are the numeric facts.</li>
                           <li>Dimensions can have <strong>hierarchies</strong> (e.g., Year -> Quarter -> Month) to support drill-down analysis.</li>
                           <li><strong>Data cubes</strong> are logical structures that allow fast retrieval of summarized data across dimensions.</li>
                           <li><strong>OLAP architectures</strong> define how this multidimensional data is stored, processed, and accessed.</li>
                           <li>A typical OLAP system uses a <strong>three-tier architecture</strong>: data warehouse, OLAP server, and client tools.</li>
                           <li>The <strong>OLAP Server</strong> is the core component that processes queries on the multidimensional data.</li>
                           <li>There are three main types of OLAP architectures: <strong>MOLAP, ROLAP, and HOLAP</strong>.</li>

                           <li><strong>ROLAP (Relational OLAP):</strong> Stores data directly in standard relational database tables.</li>
                           <li>Its strength is <strong>high scalability</strong>, as it leverages the power of relational databases to handle vast data.</li>
                           <li>However, query performance can be slower since aggregations are performed on-the-fly with SQL.</li>
                           <li><strong>HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP):</strong> Combines the speed of MOLAP with the scalability of ROLAP.</li>

                           <li><strong>Slice:</strong> Selects a single value for one dimension to create a sub-cube (e.g., sales for `Year = 2024`).</li>
                           <li><strong>Dice:</strong> Selects a range of values for multiple dimensions to create a smaller cube.</li>
                           <li><strong>Roll-up:</strong> Aggregates data along a dimension hierarchy (e.g., from daily sales to monthly sales).</li>
                           <li><strong>Drill-down:</strong> Moves from summarized data to more detailed data (e.g., from monthly to daily).</li>
                           <li><strong>Pivot (Rotate):</strong> Reorients the cube to view the data from a different perspective.</li>
